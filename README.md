## React Storefront

An experiment using react and react-router with gulp, coffeescript, sass, and jade.

## Installation

Assumes you have both node and ruby installed. Might be able to lose the ruby dependency in favour of the node sass library instead of the ruby sass gem.

```
npm install -g bower gulp coffee-script

git clone git@github.com:rapind/react-storefront.git
cd react-storefront

bundle install
npm install
bower install

gulp
```
